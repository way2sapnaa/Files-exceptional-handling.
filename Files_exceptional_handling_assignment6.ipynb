        "ANS - Logging in Python is a built-in module that provides a flexible framework for recording events, messages, and diagnostic information during program execution. It's an essential tool for debugging, monitoring, and maintaining applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Features of Python Logging:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Event Recording: Captures and stores information about what happens during program execution\n",
        "2. Multiple Severity Levels: Organizes messages by importance (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)\n",
        "3. Flexible Output: Can send logs to files, console, network, or other destinations\n",
        "4. Configurable Formatting: Customize how log messages appear\n",
        "5. Performance Efficient: Can be easily disabled in production without code changes\n",
        "Basic Logging Levels (in order of severity):\n",
        "\n",
        "* DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic information\n",
        "* INFO: General information about program execution\n",
        "* WARNING: Something unexpected happened, but program continues\n",
        "* ERROR: Serious problem occurred, some functionality failed\n",
        "* CRITICAL: Very serious error, program may not continue\n",
        "Simple Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "import logging\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Advantages of Logging:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Better than print statements for debugging\n",
        "* Can be easily turned on/off\n",
        "* Provides timestamps and context\n",

        "Q5 What is the significance of the del method in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "ANS - The del method in Python is a special method (destructor) that is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed by the garbage collector. It serves as the counterpart to init (constructor) and has several important characteristics and use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Significance of del method:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Automatic Cleanup: Called automatically when an object's reference count drops to zero or when the program ends\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Resource Management: Used to release external resources like files, network connections, or database connections\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Memory Management: Helps in cleaning up resources that Python's garbage collector might not handle automatically\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Finalizer Functionality: Acts as a finalizer to perform last-minute cleanup operations\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "class MyClass: def init(self, name): self.name = name print(f\"Object {self.name} created\")\n",
        "\n",
        "def __del__(self):\n",
        "    print(f\"Object {self.name} is being destroyed\")\n",
        "Example with Resource Management:\n",
        "\n",
        "class FileManager: def init(self, filename): self.filename = filename self.file = open(filename, 'w') print(f\"File {filename} opened\")\n",

        "def write_data(self, data):\n",

        "        print(f\"File {self.filename} closed automatically\")\n",
        "Usage\n",
        "fm = FileManager(\"test.txt\") fm.write_data(\"Hello World\") del fm # Triggers del method\n",
        "\n",
        "Important Considerations:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Not Guaranteed Timing: __del__ is called when the object is garbage collected, but the timing is not guaranteed\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Circular References: Objects involved in circular references might not have __del__ called immediately\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Exception Handling: Exceptions in __del__ are ignored and only a warning is printed to stderr\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Better Alternatives: Context managers (with statement) and try/finally blocks are often preferred for resource management\n",
        "Best Practices:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Use __del__ sparingly and only when necessary\n",
        "* Prefer context managers for resource management\n",
        "* Don't rely on __del__ for critical cleanup operations\n",
        "* Keep __del__ methods simple and exception-free\n",
        "The del method provides a safety net for resource cleanup, but explicit resource management using context managers or try/finally blocks is generally more reliable and predictable.\n",
